        Software engineer with 6+ years experience of bridging complex backend
        systems to constrained low-latency consumer interfaces, such as biometrics,
        handhelds, and smart carts. Delivers customer-driven solutions from MVP
        through production scale. Implements data-driven systems with end-to-end
        observability across mission-critical services.

        \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
            \item Led team to deliver an external service endpoint for Amazon
                  One (\textit{AO}) Enterprise devices, enabling palm-based
                  authentication for third-party enterprise clients using the
                  AWS Console. Managed sensitive biometric data (Palm Images,
                  Biometric IDs, Badge IDs) across internal systems while
                  scaling to 1000 TPS across 12 APIs.

            \item Drove delivery of a Kotlin-based Android App
                  for Amazon One clients to verify customer 21+ eligibility
                  through a palm scan. Worked with product and
                  the AO framework owners to devise a user workflow that fit
                  device constraints of the off-the-shelf Android device
                  framework and the custom AO device. For example, extended
                  views and functionality on the AO device based on its
                  connectivity status to the external device.

            \item Collaborated across teams to add Starbucks Gift Card support
                  to the Amazon One palm hover experience for fast checkout.
                  Extended backend systems to map 3rd party identifiers, such
                  as a Gift Card barcode, to internal biometric identifiers
                  on-device through a secure API.

        \vspace{-.1cm}
        \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
            \item Drove \$40M in operational savings by developing and rolling
                  out an Inventory Restocking application running on
                  commercial-grade handheld scanners (Honeywell), enabling
                  store associates to scan and submit forecasted item
                  quantities to vendors for replenishment. Launched an MVP in
                  10 pilot locations and scaled to 500+ WFM stores
                  nationwide. This was the first technical collaboration
                  between Amazon and Whole Foods post-acquisition.

            \item Architected and mentored team through extensions for the
                  Inventory Restocking application to have it proactively
                  suggest items to store associates based on a stream of
                  item forecasting events. Negotiated new app workflow and API
                  contracts with product and UX, prioritizing delivery
                  across MVP and production phases while scaling to millions
                  of events daily without impacting store operations.

            \item Led design and implementation of smart dashcart checkout
                  for "Just Walk Out" shopping. Delivered a
                  workflow solution that auto-charged an account when
                  customers entered a 'checkout zone' and emailed
                  receipts upon store exit. Used serverless architecture to
                  keep overhead at a minimum while maintaining app
                  monitoring via observable metrics.

                  3 proxy routing and application firewalls. Reduced deployment

                  standards.
