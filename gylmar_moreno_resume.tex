        \item[Amazon - AWS] \hfill \textit{May 2022- June 2024}
        \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
            \item Led and mentored the team in delivering a public
            endpoint service for customer-facing Amazon One (\textit{AO}) Enterprise Devices.
            The service efficiently managed high traffic while maintaining data integrity and
            confidentiality; it encrypted Palm Images, Biometric IDs, and Badge IDs through
            backend security measures, ensuring secure transmission, utilization, and
            modification of data across all internally-facing components. This allowed customers
            to use Corporate Badges stored in internal systems by simply hovering their palm over
            externally-facing Amazon devices.

            \item Developed a Kotlin-based Android App for Amazon One clients to verify
            21+ eligibility of a customer at stadiums using an external-facing AO device and
            an off-the-shelf Android device. Implemented HMAC encryption between wired
            devices to ensure data integrity and confidentiality when transmitting data received from
            a palm hover.

            \item Extended the customer-facing AO Android App to support Starbucks gift card
            payments. Delivered this more generally by linking 3rd party data, such as a SBX barcode,
            to internal identifiers on-device through a secure API.

        \end{itemize}

        \item[Amazon - Whole Foods Market] \hfill \textit{Sept 2018 - May 2022}
        \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
            \item Led the development and rollout of an Inventory Restocking application,
            launching an MVP in 10 pilot stores and scaling to over 500 WFM stores nationwide.
            Ensured smooth rollouts system-wide using feature flags and code pipelines.
            Designed end-to-end solutions to guide team implementations for efficiency, scale and
            maintenance, reaching millions of item events daily at peak. Delivered \$40M in annual savings
            through improved store operations.

            \item Led design and implementation of two smart dashcart processes for customers.
            Designed automated workflows triggered when customers entered a ‘checkout zone’ and
            implemented receipt/email confirmations upon store exit. Delivered primarily via serverless
            functions and workflows to keep application overhead at a minimum while observing metrics
            for monitoring and optimization.
        \end{itemize}

        \item[Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR) via SAIC] \hfill \textit{May 2017 - July 2018}
        \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
        \item Enhanced service deployment and network security for the v22 Osprey data
            infrastructure by automating RedHat instance provisioning and network configuration
            with VMware and Ansible. Developed dynamic Layer 3 proxy routing and application
            firewalls, contributing to a more reliable and secure data environment.
        \end{itemize}

        \item[Comcast via Tureus] \hfill \textit{March 2017}
        \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
            \item Developed an ETL pipeline to ingest parking meter data into
            PostgreSQL using Python microservices and Kafka topics. Designed flexible
            schemas with Alembic migrations to improve data accessibility
            and analysis.
        \end{itemize}

        \item[RetailOps] \hfill \textit{Feb 2013 - Dec 2016}
        \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
            \item Delivered improvements to client data access
            by building and maintaining data pipelines and infrastructure.
            Key accomplishments include: real-time data integration from RabbitMQ
            to MongoDB, consolidating client data from their API's to MySQL,
            optimized media delivery with a NodeJS proxy, and enhanced
            client search capabilities through Elasticsearch.
        \end{itemize}
