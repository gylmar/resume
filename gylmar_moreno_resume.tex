        \item[Amazon - AWS] \hfill \textit{May 2022 - June 2024}
        \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
            \item Led and mentored the team in delivering a public endpoint
                  service for customer-facing Amazon One (\textit{AO})
                  Enterprise Devices. The service efficiently managed high
                  traffic while maintaining data integrity and
                  confidentiality; it encrypted Palm Images, Biometric IDs,
                  and Badge IDs through backend security measures, ensuring
                  secure transmission, utilization, and modification of data
                  across all internally-facing components. This allowed
                  customers to use Corporate Badges stored in internal
                  systems by simply hovering their palm over
                  externally-facing Amazon devices.

            \item Developed a Kotlin-based Android App for Amazon One clients
                  to verify 21+ eligibility of a customer at stadiums using an
                  external-facing AO device and an off-the-shelf Android
                  device. Implemented HMAC encryption between wired devices
                  to ensure data integrity and confidentiality when
                  transmitting data received from a palm hover.

            \item Extended the customer-facing AO Android App to support
                  Starbucks gift card payments. Delivered this more generally
                  by linking 3rd party data, such as a SBX barcode, to
                  internal identifiers on-device through a secure API.

        \end{itemize}

        \item[Amazon - Whole Foods Market] \hfill \textit{Sept 2018 - May 2022}
        \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
            \item Led the development and rollout of an Inventory Restocking
                  application, launching an MVP in 10 pilot stores and scaling
                  to over 500 WFM stores nationwide. Ensured smooth rollouts
                  system-wide using feature flags and code pipelines. Designed
                  end-to-end solutions to guide team implementations for
                  efficiency, scale and maintenance, reaching millions of item
                  events daily at peak. Delivered \$40M in annual savings
                  through improved store operations.

            \item Led design and implementation of two smart dashcart checkout
                  processes to enable "Just Walk Out" shopping. Built AWS SWF
                  workflows triggered at 'checkout zones' to auto-charge their
                  account-linked credit card along with email receipt workflow
                  confirmations upon store exit. Used serverless architecture
                  to keep application overhead at a minimum and enable
                  monitoring via observable metrics.
        \end{itemize}

        \item[Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR) via SAIC] \hfill
        \textit{May 2017 - July 2018}
        \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
            \item Enhanced service deployment and network security for the v22
                  Osprey data infrastructure by automating RedHat instance
                  provisioning and network configuration with VMware and
                  Ansible. Developed dynamic Layer 3 proxy routing and
                  application firewalls, contributing to a more reliable and
                  secure data environment.
        \end{itemize}

        \item[Comcast via Tureus] \hfill \textit{March 2017}
        \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
            \item Developed an ETL pipeline to ingest parking meter data into
                  PostgreSQL using Python microservices and Kafka topics.
                  Designed flexible schemas with Alembic migrations to improve
                  data accessibility and analysis.
        \end{itemize}

        \item[RetailOps] \hfill \textit{Feb 2013 - Dec 2016}
        \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
            \item Delivered improvements to client data access by building and
                  maintaining data pipelines and infrastructure. Key
                  accomplishments include: real-time data integration from
                  RabbitMQ to MongoDB, consolidating client data from their
                  API's to MySQL, optimized media delivery with a NodeJS
                  proxy, and enhanced client search capabilities through
                  Elasticsearch.
