        \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
            \item Led team of 4 to deliver a public, idempotent 
            REST API for Amazon One (\textit{AO}) Enterprise, enabling palm-based
            authentication for third-party enterprise clients using the
            AWS Console. Engineered high-performance Java service for securing
            sensitive biometric data (Palm Images, Biometric IDs, Badge IDs)
            via envelope encryption (AWS KMS). Achieved sub-200ms p99 latency
            at 1000 transactions per second across 12 APIs.

            \item Drove team of 3 to deliver a native Android/Kotlin App
            that integrates with Amazon One (\textit{AO}). It enabled clients
            to verify customer 21+ eligibility through a palm scan. Architected
            a resilient state machine on the AO device to handle complex backend
            auth flows within the constrained Android UI, mitigating inconsistent
            states caused by intermittent connectivity. 
            
            \item Collaborated across teams to add Starbucks gift card support
            to the Amazon One palm hover experience for fast checkout.
            Extended backend systems to map 3rd party identifiers, such
            as a Gift Card barcode, to internal biometric identifiers
            on-device through a secure API.

        \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
            \item Drove \$40M in operational savings by developing and rolling
            out an Inventory Restocking mobile web application running on 
            commercial-grade handheld scanners (Honeywell), enabling
            store associates to scan and submit forecasted item
            quantities to vendors for replenishment. Launched an MVP in 10
            pilot locations and scaled to 500+ physical stores nationwide.

            \item Spearheaded event-driven architecture for real-time inventory
            suggestions, via SNS-based forecasting. Built resilience using SQS
            and parallel Lambda instances, implementing time-zone aware
            prioritization to guarantee 100\% on-time delivery of inventory
            lists managed in DynamoDB for nationwide store replenishment.

            \item Architected and delivered idempotent batch APIs and backend
            jobs that improved action latency by 90\%. Optimized payload sizes
            and reduced network overhead by having batch APIs process store
            section IDs rather than individual item IDs, improving background job
            initiation latency. This ensured responsive UI interactions in
            high-latency store environments, scaling to millions of items
            processed daily.

            \item Led design and implementation of Dash Cart Checkout
            for "Just Walk Out" shopping. Delivered a
            workflow solution that auto-charged an account when
            customers entered a 'checkout zone' and emailed
            receipts upon store exit. Built serverless workflow using AWS SWF to
            keep state management at a minimum while maintaining app
            monitoring via observable metrics.

        \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
            \item Engineered infrastructure automation for Bell Boeing V22
            Osprey Aircraft support, securing data environments via dynamic
            Layer 3 proxy routing and application firewalls. Reduced
            deployment friction by automating a largely manual process
            with Ansible, enabling lab technicians to continuously deploy to
            a secured lab environment.
