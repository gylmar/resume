        Full-lifecycle Software Engineer with 6+ years bridging distributed
        backends to constrained consumer devices --- web, biometrics, handhelds, and
        smart carts. Ships observable, CI/CD-driven solutions from MVP to
        production scale.

        \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
            \item Led team to deliver a public, idempotent
            REST API for third-party enterprise identity verification using
            palm hover as input (Amazon One
            Enterprise). Engineered high-performance Java service with
            compliance-grade encryption (AWS KMS) for sensitive credential data
            such as customer palm images. Achieved sub-200ms p99 latency at 1000
            transactions per second across 12 APIs.

            \item Drove team to deliver a native Android/Kotlin App
            that integrates with Amazon One (\textit{AO}) over a USB connection.
            Architected a resilient state machine to handle
            complex backend auth flows within the constrained Android UI,
            mitigating inconsistent states caused by intermittent connectivity ---
            enabling merchants to verify customer 21+ eligibility on the
            connected device after a customer palm scan on the AO device.
            
            \item Extended backend identity-mapping systems and Amazon One
            (\textit{AO}) to support third-party payment credentials via secure
            on-device API --- enabling Starbucks Gift Card checkout through palm
            verification.

        \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
            \item Drove \$40M in operational savings by delivering an
            Inventory Restocking web app for commercial-grade handheld scanners
            (Honeywell). Launched the MVP in 10 pilot locations and scaled to
            500+ physical stores nationwide, processing forecasted replenishment
            quantities at scale. This was the first technical collaboration
            between Amazon and Whole Foods post-acquisition.

            \item Negotiated expanded app workflow and API contracts with Product 
            and UX. Architected and mentored team through delivery
            of an event-driven pipeline (SNS, SQS, parallel Lambdas) for
            real-time inventory suggestions. Implemented time-zone aware
            prioritization to guarantee 100\% on-time delivery
            of forecasting data managed in DynamoDB.

            \item Architected and delivered idempotent batch APIs and backend
            jobs that improved action latency by 90\% by processing store
            sections over individual items --- reducing payload sizes and network
            overhead. Greatly improved in-store app experience for associates
            in high-latency environments, with batch APIs scaling out to millions
            of items ordered daily.

            \item Partnered with Payment teams to architect and deliver an
            automated payment lifecycle job using AWS SWF --- from auto-charging
            at smart-cart zone entry through emailing receipts at charge
            settlement. This powered the "Just Walk Out" shopping
            experience for Whole Foods smart-cart customers.

        \textit{2017 - 2018}
        \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
            \item Engineered infrastructure automation for Bell Boeing V22
            Osprey Aircraft support systems. Created Ansible-driven deployment
            scripts to configure hosts as highly secured environments,
            including dynamic Layer 3 proxy routing and application firewalls.
            Reduced deployment time from hours to minutes across secured lab
            environments.
